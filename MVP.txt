I want to create an android application, it will be used to store data about books.
The App should have a search box at the top of the screen where a user can input a title, author or ISBN number, it should then search through https://openlibrary.org/ for the item.
The information returned should be the book cover, title, and author.
Selecting the book should then give an option to mark the book as owned, a text field to enter the page number currently on, and another tick box to select that the user has finished reading the book.
The data entered for the book by the user should be stored locally. 

Overview

Select a book, openes the detailed page containing, title, auther, shot descption, option to mark as owned, option to enter page number, option to mark as want to read.
Filters at the top of the homepage.

SQL database

-Searches
--ID, date&time, search term.
-books
--ISBN(PK), name, auther, bookCover.png, shot description, owned?, wantToRead?, pagenumber, read?, compleationDate, index(max 20) 

index is used to order the books on the homepage, once a book is selected it is added to the DB and given index 1 and all others are X+1 while item 31 is made null.

Infomration will be gathered from open libary API 

Date & Time is usead to display the last 5 searches made when searching. 

Nice to have.
